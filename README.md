# Flag Spotting

During 2023, I travelled to many countries. Inspired by posts on the r/vexillology subreddit, I decided to count every flag I saw during 2023. This webpage presents all of those flags and the number of times I saw each individual flag.

The flags top ten most frequently seen flags were:
1. EU
2. Norway
3. Italy
4. Greece
5. UK
6. Montenegro
7. TÃ¼rkiye
8. Ukraine
9. France
10. France (variant)
